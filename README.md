# Local-Ecommerce-Sales-Data-Using-Power-BI
Power BI Project

👋 Hello!
Welcome to my Power BI journey through the colorful chaos of local e-commerce! In this project, I’ve visualized Q4 sales data from a fictional e-commerce store across India, uncovering trends, behaviors, and business opportunities hidden in rows of numbers.
What started as a data cleanup task turned into a story of growth, habits, and high-performing products—and I’m excited to walk you through it!

🧩 What’s Inside?
This dashboard answers real business questions with the help of visuals, filters, and just the right amount of DAX magic. Whether you’re a store owner, analyst, or just someone who loves dashboards (like me!), you’ll find insights that make numbers make sense.

🛠 Tools I Used
- Power BI Desktop: For dashboarding, modeling, and storytelling
- Power Query: To fix messy data and get it dashboard-ready
- DAX: For creating key metrics like AOV (Average Order Value)

🚀 Key Features
- Interactive visualizations (because nobody loves static tables!)
- KPI Cards highlighting sales, profit, quantity, and AOV
- Slicers that let you filter by state, customer, product category, or quarter
- Charts showing sales trends by time, geography, and sub-categories
- Insights into how people pay—COD, UPI, card, or EMI

📊 Highlights from the Dashboard
🔹 Total Sales: ₹438K across 5615 items
🔹 Top States: Maharashtra, Delhi, and MP drive the highest revenue
🔹 Biggest Buyers: Shoutout to Priyanka, Abhishek & team—loyal shoppers 💸
🔹 Popular Product Categories: Clothing steals the spotlight in volume
🔹 Most Profitable Items: Printers, Bookcases & Accessories bring in the real ₹₹₹
🔹 Payment Trends: COD is still king, but UPI and cards are catching up

💡 What I Learned
- High quantity doesn’t always mean high profit—Clothing sold the most, but Electronics and Furniture earned more
- Regional trends are real: the same category performs differently in different states
- Even with fewer orders, customers like Priyanka make a big impact—customer segmentation matters
- Design matters. A dashboard is not just about data, it’s about making people want to explore it

🧠 Business Insights
- Double down on high-margin categories like Printers and Bookcases
- Reward loyal customers—they’re your biggest asset
- Introduce payment incentives to promote digital transactions
- Prep for Q4 early—sales peak during festive months like October

💭 About the Data
This dashboard is built on Q4 sales data, sourced from a structured Excel sheet. While it focuses on offline/physical store performance in India, the visualizations can be adapted to other quarters or datasets with minimal tweaks.

📌 How to Use It
- Open Local_Ecommerce_Sales.pbix in Power BI Desktop
- Filter by category, customer, or region using slicers
- Hover for tooltips, explore sub-categories, and connect the dots
- Update the dataset to use it for new quarters or business units

❤️ A Note from Me
This project isn’t just about charts and KPIs—it’s about showing how the right visuals can help you make the right decisions. If you liked it or want to collaborate, I’m just one message away!
